Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* assets/ => app/src/main/assets/
* libs/AMap_3DMap_V2.2.1.jar => app/libs/AMap_3DMap_V2.2.1.jar
* libs/afinal_0.5.1_bin.jar => app/libs/afinal_0.5.1_bin.jar
* libs/android-support-v7-recyclerview.jar => app/libs/android-support-v7-recyclerview.jar
* libs/ihaveu_util_library.jar => app/libs/ihaveu_util_library.jar
* res/ => app/src/main/res/
* src/ => app/src/main/java/
* Test/res/ => app/src/androidTest/res
* Test/src/ => app/src/androidTest/java/

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

(This import summary is for your information only, and can be deleted
after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
